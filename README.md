# Capstone-Proposal


## Please edit this README.md file based on your Capstone project idea.

### Project Title:
Reducing traffic caused by accidents  utilizing car dash cam.

### Group Members:
- Rayan Baghdadi
- Hussain
- Sadeem
- Hajar
- Arwa

### Objectives:
Building a model that takes video as an input in order to process it using various algorithms, resulting in a report that demonstrates who was responsible for the accident. As a result, drivers that were involved in the accident can immediately move to reduce traffic congestion and improve overall safety.

### Dataset Description:
- Some images and videos taken from the dash cam.
